== Description ==

Useful on multiauthor blogs and magazines, where you can reserve your subject you are writing abou, so nobody else start writing about the same. If you have the strong subject to write about and no time to do so, you just add it there and leave for others to pick up if interesting. Or, on the other hand, if you are searching what to write about, you can find what others added there.

However this is still beta, it is fully functional. I just feel it need some usability tweaks and by usage you'll find what is missing. If so, please write me about it to jan@varhol.sk. This plugin was developed mainly for non-profit organisation Ãšlet magazine in Slovakia. The slovak translation is included. If you plan transtale it to your language write me so I can send you the .po file.

Be aware that when logged in as administrator, you can edit and change a lot, bud when logged just as author, you can change only your staff.
